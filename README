STBVorbis-CS: A C# wrapper for stb_vorbis.

License
-------
STBVorbis-CS is licensed under the zlib license. stb_vorbis is in the public
domain.

Note
----
STBVorbis-CS is NOT complete: it only provides the bare minimum to get
something up and running. Patches to add support for more functions are, of
course, welcome.

How to build
------------
Building STBVorbis-CS is simple! Just run:

 make

Both stb_vorbis and STBVorbis-CS will be built. There are also precompiled
binaries in the binaries directory for x86 and x86_64 systems. These have
been built with bingcc, so they should work even on very old distros!
